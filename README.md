# Importance Weighted Autoencoders
Replication and discussion of experiments from the papers "Importance Weighted Autoencoders" ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00519 ) and "Tighter Variational Bounds are Not Necessarily Better" ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04537 ) on importance weighted variational autoencoders (IWAEs).
Full description of the project is available in the pdf IWAE_replication.pdf.
This was a joint work with Jamie Lee and Nicholas Pezzotti.

# Setup
The code was run using Tensorflow version 2.4.1 and Numpy version 1.19.5
